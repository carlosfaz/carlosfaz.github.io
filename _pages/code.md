Code related to projects I have been involved in.

1. BehaveML -- DeepLabCut post-analysis package for animal behavior classification ([pypi](https://pypi.org/project/behaveml))
2. A Flask-based flight tracking web app ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/flying-overhead)), and a Flask-Ask based Alexa skill that uses local ADSB-receiver data so you can ask your Echo what planes are nearby. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/raspberry-fly))
3. Third place winning code for multi-agent behavior challenge -- Keras and Scikit-learn-based mouse behavior classifier. Run by AICrowd, [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/multi-agent-behavior-representation-modeling-measurement-and-applications). ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/mabetask1_ml))
4. TensorFlow code for meta-reinforcement learning algorithms for solving causal learning tasks ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/Meta-RL))
5. Implementations of common linear contextual bandit algorithms ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/conservativerdd))
6. Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) network that learns using causal inference (regression discontinuity design). ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/rdd))
7. Simple total variation image segmentation implemention ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/segmentation)) 
8. Generalized linear model (GLM) estimation and spike-train analysis, related to dual-control brain-computer interfaces. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/dualbci))
9. Neuroinformatics primer: Demonstration of GLM, STA, STC, and other methods on common datasets. ([github](https://github.com/NeuroInfoPrimer/primer))
10. Simulation of reaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves. ([github](https://github.com/benlansdell/retinalwaves))
